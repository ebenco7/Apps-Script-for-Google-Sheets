# Apps-Script-for-Google-Sheets

# I created the first sheet (ICT) in Year level moderation sheets then use the apps script to duplicate, modify editor and protect sheet. Since the moderation sheet is to accesed by different educators, I ensure that an educator is assigned to the sheet labelled as the subject the educator teaches.
